					<ul>
					<li> 1. Amoxicillin 
                    <br>
It shouldn't be surprising that the most commonly prescribed medications for children. Amoxil (amoxicillin) is very inexpensive as a generic drug and is usually well tolerated. It can treat strep throat as well as childhood pneumonia, ear infections, and sinus infections, especially when used at high-dose levels
                        
                    <li> 2. Azithromycin
                    <br>
Another antibiotic, Zithromax (azithromycin) is also available as a generic. It has the convenience of being just once a day for five days, three days (ear infections), or even just one dose (ear infections).
                        
                    <li> 3. Albuterol
                        <br>
The first drug on the list that isn't an antibiotic, albuterol is a bronchodilator that is used to relieve asthma symptoms. It is available in a form for a nebulizer and as a metered dose inhaler (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA, etc.). The syrup form of albuterol is very rarely used by most pediatricians.

Albuterol nebulizer solution is an inexpensive medication. Albuterol asthma inhalers are more expensive. There is a Ventolin HFA inhaler with only 60 actuations (vs 200 in most other inhalers) that is less expensive.
                    
                        
                    <li> 4. Amoxicillin/Clavulanate
                        <br>
Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) combines amoxicillin with the Î²-lactamase inhibitor potassium clavulanate to help it overcome resistant bacteria. It is commonly used to treat ear infections, sinus infections, pneumonia, infected bites, and oral infections. High-dose Augmentin (Augmentin ES) is also available to help treat resistant Streptococcus pneumononiae infections.
                        
                    <li> 5. Cefdinir
                        <br>
Omnicef (cefdinir) is a broad spectrum third-generation cephalosporin that is commonly used to treat sinus infections, ear infections, and pneumonia. Cefdinir is not usually considered to be a first-line treatment. In general, cefdinir is a little more expensive than some other antibiotics.
                    <li> 6. Cephalexin
                        <br>
Unlike many of the other antibiotics on this list, Keflex (cephalexin), has a more narrow range of action, treating strep throat, skin infections (cellulitis and impetigo), and bone and joint infections, etc. It is a first-generation cephalosporin. It is available as an inexpensive generic.
                        
                    <li> 7. Fluticasone
                        <br>
Fluticasone is a steroid that is the main ingredient in many different medications, including Flonase nasal spray (generic), Flovent MDI, Cutivate cream and ointment (generic), and Veramyst nasal spray. Depending on the formulation, it can be used to treat kids with eczema, allergies, and/or asthma, etc. Generic fluticasone propionate nasal spray is now available over-the-counter and is one of the less expensive prescription nasal allergy medications.
                        
                        <li> 8. Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate
                            <br>
Available in both a 25 milligram/5 milliliter and 15 milligram/5 milliliter syrup, prednisolone is a liquid steroid that is commonly used to treat flare-ups of asthma, poison ivy reactions, croup, and other corticosteroid-responsive disorders.
                            
                        <li> 9. Ibuprofen
                            <br>
Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to treat fever, pain, and inflammation in children. Although available over-the-counter (Motrin and Advil), there are also prescription-strength formulations of ibuprofen.
                            
                        <li>10. Singulair (Montelukast Sodium)
                            <br>
Singulair (montelukast sodium) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist and is approved to prevent and treat asthma, prevent exercise-induced asthma, and relieve symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis. It is now available as a generic.
                            
                        <li> 11. Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole
                            <br>
Bactrim or Septra (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) is an older antibiotic that is most commonly used to treat urinary tract infections, except when resistance might be a problem. It is also being used more often now to treat methicillin-resistant staph aureus infections (MRSA).
                            
                        <li> 12. Codeine Phosphate/Acetaminophen
                            <br>
This is a narcotic pain reliever with Tylenol (acetaminophen). The FDA warns that codeine should only be used when the benefits will outweigh the risks, which can include unusual sleepiness, confusion, shallow breathing, and other signs of morphine overdose.
                            
                        <li> 13. Hydrocodone Bitartrate/Acetaminophen
                            <br>
This is a narcotic pain reliever with Tylenol (acetaminophen) that is more potent than codeine.
                            
                        <li> 14. Mupirocin
                            <br>
Bactroban (mupirocin) is a topical antibiotic that is often prescribed to treat bacterial skin infections, such as impetigo. Although both mupirocin cream and ointment are both available as generics, mupirocin ointment is considerably less expensive than the cream.
                            
                        <li> 15. Nystatin
                            <br>
Most parents are familiar with Nystatin, an antifungal medication that is used to treat yeast infections, including thrush and candidal diaper rashes.
